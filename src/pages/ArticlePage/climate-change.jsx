          Present-day climate change refers to both global warming—the ongoing increase in the average global temperature—and the broader effects this phenomenon has on Earth's climate. In a wider context, climate change also encompasses long-term changes in Earth's climate that have occurred historically. The current rise in global temperatures is primarily driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. This includes the use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and certain agricultural and industrial practices, all of which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap some of the heat that the Earth emits after absorbing sunlight, resulting in the warming of the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming, has increased by about 50% and is now at levels not seen for millions of years.

          Climate change is having an increasingly significant impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, and heat waves and wildfires are becoming more frequent. The accelerated warming in the Arctic has led to thawing permafrost, the retreat of glaciers, and a decline in sea ice. Higher temperatures are also resulting in more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental changes in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic are forcing many species to either relocate or face extinction. Even if efforts to limit future warming are successful, some effects, such as ocean heating, ocean acidification, and rising sea levels, will persist for centuries.
          </p>

          <p>
          Climate change poses significant threats to humanity, including increased flooding, extreme heat, scarcity of food and water, a rise in diseases, and economic losses. It can also lead to human migration and conflict. The World Health Organization identifies climate change as one of the greatest threats to global health in the 21st century. Without measures to limit global warming, societies, and ecosystems will face increasingly severe risks. While adapting to climate change—through initiatives like flood control measures or the development of drought-resistant crops—can help mitigate some of these risks, there are limits to what can be achieved through adaptation. Moreover, poorer communities contribute only a small fraction of global emissions but have the least capacity to adapt and are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

          </p>

          <p>Many impacts of climate change have been observed in the early decades of the 21st century, with 2023 noted as the warmest year on record, reaching an increase of 1.48 °C (2.66 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850. If additional warming occurs, it can exacerbate these impacts and potentially trigger tipping points, such as the complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet. </p>

          <p>Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively committed to keeping global warming "well under 2 °C." However, based on the current pledges made under this Agreement, global warming is still projected to reach approximately 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century. To limit warming to 1.5 °C, emissions would need to be halved by 2030 and net-zero emissions must be achieved by 2050.</p>
<p>Fossil fuel use can be eliminated by conserving energy and transitioning to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon emissions. These sources include wind, solar, hydroelectric, and nuclear power. Cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for transportation, building heating, and industrial processes. Additionally, carbon can be removed from the atmosphere by increasing forest cover and using agricultural methods that capture carbon in the soil.</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>Before the 1980s, it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates from air pollution. During this time, scientists used the term "inadvertent climate modification" to refer to human impacts on the climate. In the 1980s, "global warming" and "climate change" became more common and were often used interchangeably. Scientifically, global warming specifically refers to the increase in surface temperatures, while climate change encompasses both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, including changes in precipitation patterns.</p>
<p>Climate change can refer to contemporary and historical changes in the Earth’s climate. The term "global warming" was first used in the mid-1970s but gained significant popularity after NASA climate scientist James Hansen referenced it during his testimony before the U.S. Senate in 1988. Since the 2000s, "climate change" has become increasingly common. Various scientists, politicians, and media outlets may use the terms "climate crisis" or "climate emergency" to describe climate change, and some may prefer the term "global heating" instead of "global warming."</p>
