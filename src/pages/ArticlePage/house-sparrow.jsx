          <p>
          The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is a small bird belonging to the sparrow family, Passeridae. It is found in most parts of the world and typically measures about 16 cm (6.3 in) in length and weighs between 24 and 39.5 g (0.85–1.39 oz). Female and young house sparrows are generally colored pale brown and grey, while males have more vibrant black, white, and brown markings. This bird is one of about 25 species within the genus Passer and is native to most of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and a large part of Asia, including India. Thanks to intentional and accidental introductions to various regions—including parts of Australasia, Africa, and the Americas—it has become the most widely distributed wild bird.
          </p>

          <p>
          The house sparrow is closely associated with human habitation and can thrive in both urban and rural environments. Although it can adapt to a variety of habitats and climates, the house sparrow typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, polar regions, and hot, deserts far from human development. For food, the house sparrow often visits homes and public bird feeding stations, but it naturally feeds on seeds from grains, flowering plants, and weeds. As an opportunistic and omnivorous eater, it also consumes insects, their larvae, caterpillars, invertebrates, and a range of other natural foods.

          </p>
          <p>Due to its abundance and strong association with human settlements, the house sparrow holds cultural significance. It is often persecuted as an agricultural pest, although this is usually unsuccessful. Additionally, house sparrows have been kept as pets and have served as food. They symbolize various concepts, including lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. While the house sparrow is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some regions. Nonetheless, its conservation status is currently listed as "Least Concern" on the IUCN Red List.</p>
