          <h2> The Indus Valley Civilization (3300–1700 BCE)</h2>
          <p>
            One of the earliest urban civilizations, the Indus Valley
            Civilization thrived in what is now Pakistan and northwest India. It
            was known for its advanced city planning, drainage systems, and
            trade, making it a cradle of early human progress.

          <h2> The Vedic Age (1500–600 BCE)</h2>
          <p>
            During this transformative period, the Vedas were composed,
            establishing the essential foundation for Hinduism. As society
            embraced agrarian lifestyles, the rise of powerful kingdoms across
            the subcontinent marked a significant shift towards organized
            governance and cultural development.

          <h2>The Mauryan Empire (321–185 BCE) </h2>
          <p>
            {" "}
            The Mauryan Empire was the first major empire of ancient India,
            founded by Chandragupta Maurya. It united most of the Indian
            subcontinent, becoming one of the largest empires of its era.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Chandragupta Maurya: </strong>Established the empire by
              defeating the Nanda Dynasty and expanded its territory through
              alliances and conquests.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bindusara: </strong> Continued territorial expansion into
              central and southern India.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ashoka the Great: </strong> The empire reached its peak
              under Ashoka, who embraced Buddhism after the Kalinga War and
              promoted peace and welfare through his Dhamma policy.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Ashoka Chakra on the national flag of India</h2>
          <p>
            The Ashoka Chakra on India's national flag is closely associated
            with the Maurya Empire and its third ruler, Emperor Ashoka.
            Following his violent conquest of Kalinga, Ashoka adopted Buddhism
            and committed himself to the principles of peace, moral values, and
            justice. The chakra symbolizes this transformation, representing a
            shift from military expansion to the promotion of Dharma
            (righteousness), non-violence, and effective governance.
          </p>
          <strong>Achievements </strong>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> </strong> Centralized administration with Pataliputra as
              the capital.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong></strong>Promoted trade, agriculture, and infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> </strong> Iconic Ashokan Pillars and Buddhist Stupas like
              Sanchi reflect its architectural legacy.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The empire declined after Ashoka's death, leading to the rise of the
            Shunga Dynasty. Its legacy centers on unification, governance, and
            the spread of Buddhism throughout Asia.

          <h2>The Gupta Empire (320–550 CE)</h2>
          <p>
            The Gupta period, often referred to as India's "Golden Age," was
            marked by significant advancements in science, mathematics, art, and
            literature. Notable scholars such as Aryabhata and Kalidasa thrived
            during this time.
          </p>
          <h2>The Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526)</h2>
          <p>
            The Delhi Sultanate, a remarkable period of Islamic rule, brought
            with it the rich heritage of Persian art, architecture, and advanced
            administrative systems, leaving a lasting and profound impact on
            Indian culture that cannot be overlooked.
          </p>

          <h2>The Mughal Empire (1526–1857)</h2>

          <p>
            The Mughals were renowned for their cultural and architectural
            contributions, including the Taj Mahal, and presided over a period
            marked by prosperity and cultural synthesis. Akbar’s policies
            promoted religious tolerance, while Aurangzeb’s expansionist
            campaigns defined this significant era.
          </p>

          <h2>Colonial Era (1757–1947)</h2>
          <p>
            The British East India Company took control after the Battle of
            Plassey in 1757, leading to a period of colonial rule. This era was
            marked by the exploitation of resources, significant socio-economic
            changes, and the rise of nationalist movements such as the Indian
            National Congress.
          </p>
          <h2>Independence and Partition (1947)</h2>
          <p>
            India achieved independence on August 15, 1947, after decades of
            struggle led by figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.
            However, the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan, causing
            widespread migration and violence.
          </p>
          <h2>Post-Independence Era</h2>
          <p>
            India emerged as a vibrant democratic republic in 1950, marking the
            beginning of significant economic reforms, ambitious space
            exploration, and positioning itself as a formidable global player in
            technology and diplomacy.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Contributions of Indian History</h2>

          <p>
            • Religion: Birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Science Contributions in astronomy, mathematics (e.g., the concept
            of zero), and medicine.
          </p>
          <p>

            and Ellora caves, and temple architecture.
